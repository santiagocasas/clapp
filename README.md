</p>

CLAPP is a Streamlit application that provides an AI pair programming assistant specialized in the CLASS cosmology code. It uses LangChain and OpenAI models, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with CLASS documentation and code examples to provide informed responses and assist with coding tasks.

## Features

* **Conversational AI:** Interact with an AI assistant knowledgeable about CLASS and cosmology.
* **CLASS Integration:** Built-in tools to install, test, and use the CLASS cosmological code.
* **Code Execution:** Executes Python code snippets in real-time, with automatic error detection and correction.
* **Plotting Support:** Generates and displays cosmological plots from CLASS outputs.
* **RAG Integration:** Retrieves relevant information from CLASS documentation and code (`./class-data/`) to answer questions accurately.
* **Multiple Response Modes:** 
  * **Fast Mode:** Quick responses with good quality (recommended for most uses)
  * **Swarm Mode:** Multi-agent refined responses for more complex questions (takes longer)
* **Secure User Management:** Username-based API key storage allows multiple users to securely save encrypted API keys.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Streams installation and execution progress in real-time.
* **Model Selection:** Choose between different OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).

## Setup and Installation

This project uses conda/mamba for environment management, which is compatible with CLASS installation requirements.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd clapp
   ```

2. **Create a conda environment from the environment.yml file:**
   ```bash
   # Using conda
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   
   # Or using mamba (faster)
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate clapp
   ```

4. **API Key:**
   * You will need an OpenAI API key.
   * The application allows you to enter a username, API key, and password to encrypt and store it locally.
   * Keys are saved as `{username}_encrypted_api_key` to allow multiple users.

5. **CLASS Installation:**
   * CLAPP includes a built-in CLASS installation button that will install CLASS from source.
   * Alternatively, you can check if CLASS is already installed using the provided tool.

6. **CLASS Data:**
   * Ensure the `class-data` directory contains the necessary CLASS documentation, code files (.py, .ini, .txt), and potentially PDF documents for the RAG system.

7. **System Prompts:**
   * Ensure the `prompts/` directory contains the necessary instruction files (`class_instructions.txt`, `review_instructions.txt`, etc.).

## Usage

1. **Activate the conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate clapp
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run CLAPP.py
   ```

3. **Setup process:**
   * Enter your OpenAI API key and optionally a username and password for encryption.
   * Initialize the application by clicking "Initialize with Selected Model".
   * Check if CLASS is installed or install it using the provided buttons.
   * Start chatting with the assistant about CLASS-related questions or cosmology code.

4. **Code execution:**
   * When the assistant provides code, you can execute it by typing "execute!" in the chat.
   * The system will run the code, display the output, and show any generated plots.
   * If errors occur, the system will automatically attempt to fix them.

## Project Structure

* `CLAPP.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
* `install_classy.sh`: Script to install CLASS from source.
* `test_classy.py`: Script to test CLASS installation and functionality.
* `environment.yml`: Conda environment specification with all required dependencies.
* `class-data/`: Directory containing data for the RAG system (CLASS code, docs, etc.).
* `prompts/`: Directory containing system prompts for the AI agents.
* `images/`: Contains images used in the app interface, including the CLAPP logo.
* `{username}_encrypted_api_key`: Stores the encrypted OpenAI API keys for each user.

## Working with CLASS

CLAPP allows you to:

1. **Learn about CLASS**: Ask questions about CLASS cosmology code features, parameters, and usage.
2. **Develop cosmology code**: Get help writing code that uses CLASS for cosmological calculations.
3. **Debug and fix errors**: Get assistance with error messages and issues in your CLASS code.
4. **Visualize results**: Generate and view plots of cosmological data.
